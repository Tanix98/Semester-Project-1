An online video game marketplace. My first attempt at building a proper website using HTML & CSS, which is why it lacks responsiveness and functionality.

## Description

GameHub is a marketplace to buy and sell video games, with a target audience of gamers aged 18 to 25. This website was created for the cross-course project between the Design and HTML & CSS courses. It was also my very first attempt at coding a proper website, which is why the website isn't very responsive.
